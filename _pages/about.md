Hi, everyone. And thanks for stopping by. My name is Sachin Abeywardana and currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Canva.

I did my PhD in Bayesian Machine Learning but every since I left have been obsessed about the wonderful world of Deep Learning. These days I'm working on bringing NLP goodness into Canva.

I have created a Udemy course on Machine Learning and can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-and-data-science-2021/?referralCode=E79228C7436D74315787). Feel free to ping me for a coupon.
